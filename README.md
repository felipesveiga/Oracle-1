# Data Analysis Project Involving Oracle SQL.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate Python's capability to interact with Oracle Databases through the usage of cx_Oracle library.

To do this, I have simulated a situation in which I work for a hardware selling company that needs to get a variety of data about its performance. My role is to get access to the company's Oracle database in order to obtain the information demanded.

My tasks are the following:
    
    1) Obtain the level of storage of each of the company's warehouses.

    2) List the most prolific salespeople.

    3) Point out the product with most units sold for each of the company's customers.

    4) Get the annual revenue per product category.

    5) Increase all CPU products price by 10%.
